            In the first 3 weeks of Correlation One's Software Development
            Program, I have learned a lot. From the basics of Hypertext Markup
            Language (HTML) such as various tags, to more complex aspects such
            as forms. Along with HTML I've learned the basics of Cascading Style
            Sheets (CSS). With what I have learned so far I can make a webpage
            that is remeniscent of the 1990's and enjoying it.

              Born and raised in the Mid-west. At the age of 6 I was asked what
              I wanted to be when he grew up? And for some unfathomable reason I
              said I wanted to be a cobbler. I have no idea why I said it or how
              I even knew what a cobbler was. Obviously my aspirations to mend
              shoes for a living was short lived. At the end of high school my
              love for film and tv led me to the idea of becoming a special
              effects technician. Sadly, this idea was also shot down after I
              found out that job security and pay of technicians wasn't the
              best. (Also I would have to move across the country and 18 year
              old me wasn't ready for that just yet.) At 21 I decided to follow
              in my father's footsteps and become a firefighter paramedic. I
              went to paramedic school and worked as an EMT-P for approximately
              8 years. I very much enjoyed my job and thought I was set.
              Unfortunately fate is a cruel mistress and in 2019 I started
              having medical issues that were not conducive with the nature of
              being an EMT, and forced me to leave the healthcare field. Unsure
              of what to do next I took a seasonal job at a Amazon distrbution
              center that had just opened near my home to hold myself over for a
              few months until I figured out what to do next. . . that was 3
              years ago. Then in June, 2023, 33 years old me was death scrolling
              through Amazon's career choices and I stumble on Correlation One's
              Software Developer program, I had taken a intro to HTML and CSS
              course in college and enjoyed it and I thought, hey this could be
              a good career path for me. Which brings us to the here and now
              enrolled in said software developer program. (And enjoying it
              might I add.) I'm happy to be here and look forward to seeing
              where this career path will take me.

              So it is the night before this project is due and I have been
              putting it off in favor of attempting to better understand the
              material we learned this week. This week has been the first time I
              really struggled with grasping the material. Perhaps it just the
              amount of information or that these concepts are more complex, or
              maybe both. Either way I am just taking it one subject at a time,
              like one of my T.A's have said. Learning to code isn't a sprint,
              its a marathon.

              Here we again, the night before the project is due. Yet again, I
              had put off trying to implement all of the new material into this
              page in an attempt to be better understand the information and not
              ruin my code. But time is the enemy and so here we are. I turned
              my previous page into a an unorganized and decided to start fresh
              on a new document. Fortunately I did manage to utilize the grid
              forrmat which is a requirment for this week's project but thats
              about all I have. I still have not had time to dive into SASS and
              bootstrap is giving me trouble. I'm attending a zoom session in
              approximately 15 min in hopes to get some answers. I'll probably
              ask for an extension at this rate.
